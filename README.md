# Exotic_Runner

Endless runner game implemented in C++ using the OpenGL graphics library. Through keyboard
interaction, the player can move on the platforms, collect coins, gain new skills, can be hit by obstacles
and fall off platforms. The realism of the scene is achieved by applying textures on objects, by
illuminating the scene in Fragment Shader and by adding decor elements in a Skybox.
